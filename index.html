  Substance abuse is a negative overuse of drugs or alcohol for more than what they are safely intended for and is the main contributor of overdose in America. Some of these drugs range from methamphetamines and opioids to fentyanyl and heroin. According to the National Institue on Drug Abuse, as of 2019, 20.4 million people in the United States were diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder. During that same year, nearly 71,000 people died due to drug overdose and addiction, and that number only incresased between 2020 & 2021.

According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, there was an approximate 107,622 drug overdose deaths in the United States during 2021. That number was a total estimate with by a whopping 15% increase from the 93,655 deaths estimated in 2020.

      Drug abuse isn't the only concern when it comes to the topic of substance abuse. Alcholism is another major contributing part to this ongoing epidemic. Did you know that during the global shutdown that COVID-19 induced, there was a studied spike in not only drug abuse, but alcohol abuse as well. About 60% of adults drink when stressed. With a combination of other factors like home situations, job based problems, binge drinking becomes a common form of substance abuse.

    <p>  As previousely stated, the ongoing pandemic added to this form of substance abuse. “The percentage of people reporting binge drinking—more than four drinks in two hours for men and three for women—increased from 22% in February to 27% in April, — Overall, 31% of respondents reported drinking alcohol more frequently while 21% reported drinking less frequently.” (A quote from the American Psychological Association) We see here that induced stress and uncertainty caused by isolation put a strain on many adults and created an increase in the percentage of regular drinking habits.
